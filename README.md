# Libft-42-
Project developed in my stay as student in 42

As a student of 42, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience by undertaking the libft project. This project allowed me to develop proficiency in various areas of programming, including:

Implementation of standard C library functions: The libft project required me to implement my own versions of several standard C library functions. This task provided me with a thorough understanding of the behavior and implementation of these functions, which has helped me to write more efficient and optimized code in my subsequent projects.

Data structures: The libft project also required me to implement several data structures, such as linked lists and binary trees. Through this exercise, I gained a deeper understanding of how these data structures work and when they are appropriate to use.

Makefiles and project management: The libft project required me to create a Makefile to compile my library, which helped me to understand the importance of proper project management and organization. This experience has proven valuable in managing and maintaining larger projects.

Coding standards and collaboration: As a student of 42, I was required to adhere to strict coding standards and collaborate with other students on projects. The libft project provided me with an opportunity to improve my coding standards and communication skills in a team environment.

Overall, the libft project provided me with a strong foundation in programming concepts and practical skills that will serve me well in my future programming endeavors.
